# Merge-Sort-Recursion
A C implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm using recursion and array merging(ATP homework)
# Merge Sort in C

This project contains a simple implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm in the C programming language.  
Merge Sort is a classic divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with a time complexity of **O(n log n)**.
## How it works
1. The user inputs the number of elements and the values.
2. The array is recursively split into halves.
3. Subarrays are merged in sorted order.
4. The final sorted array is displayed.
